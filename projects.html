            <ul class="list">
                <li>Pink Sips was a creative idea done by me and 4 of my friends. We didn't invent a new machine but we enhanced one.</li>
                <li>The idea was that we made a coffee machine where using sensors, you don't have to do anythin just place your cup.</li>
                <li>Once the sensor detects the cup, coffee granules fall into the cup and then the water starts pouring.</li>
                <li>We used simple components such as an Arduino (the brain), ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, and more tools.</li>
                <li>We worked so hard on it, and although we were exhausted, it was totally worth it!</li>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Yes, as you read a car speed detector. My colleagues and I worked together to make it.</li>
                <li>It was an easy yet effective project.</li>
                <li>We used Arduino, IR sensors, and a display screen. We used a toy car to test it and it worked perfectly.</li>
                <li>The 2 IR sensors measure time, and the distance between them was constant 5 cm.</li>
                <li>We moved the car in front of the sensors, calculating the time taken to move from one sensor to the other.</li>
                <li>Then we divided distance by time, and displayed the velocity on the screen.</li>
